# hpgl2gcode
simple script converting HPGL to gcode in a very limited way

this script is for work with the hpgl code produced with the inkscape plugin
inkcut v1.0

It's inteded to use with a 3D Printer where the nozzle header has been modified 
to have a "roland vynil cutter" o similar.

To use, prepare a vynil over the bed of the printer, put a cut pad or some similar
between the glass and the vynil.

Move manually the head of the blade to touch the vinil in the botton left corner 
and down about 0.1mm.

fire the gcode and enjoy.
